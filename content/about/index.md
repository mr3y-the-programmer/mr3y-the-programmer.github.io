I'm a product-minded self-taught Android Engineer on a mission to create useful, smooth, and secure app user-experiences.

I’ve been working on Android since 2021 — mostly on apps. but, I also have some background in developing SDKs & Libraries as well as contributing to Open-source software projects.
I like learning new technologies, adopting new approaches, and exploring new languages.

Fun fact: when I'm not coding, I'm either watching new animes or hanging out with friends.

Do you have an idea for a mobile app project? or simply want to chat? Don't hesitate to reach out and connect with me.
